## Things to improve on: 
# 1) use bayes for chosing hyperparamters or evolutions algorithm
# 2) deep neural networks and vector alogrithms could do better than a regular neural network
# 3) maybe add a stop loss (the script does this for us currently by chosing when to sell)
# 4) long time frame mean more data which means better decisions (training on 15m every 5m)

#In this code, the target variable is being defined as an array containing a series of 0s and 1s. T
# he values in the target array are determined by evaluating the following expression for each element 
# d in the data list:

# 1 if d[4] > d[1] else 0
# This expression uses an if-else statement to determine the value of the target array element 
# based on the values of d[4] and d[1]. If d[4] is greater than d[1], the element is set to 1. 
# If d[4] is less than or equal to d[1], the element is set to 0.

# In the context of the list of lists you provided earlier, each element in the list represents 
# a time period and contains the following values:

#d[0]: Timestamp (in milliseconds)
#d[1]: Open price
#d[2]: Highest price
#d[3]: Lowest price
#d[4]: Closing price
#d[5]: Volume (in terms of the base currency)

# So, in this context, d[4] represents the closing price and d[1] represents the open price for a 
# given time period. The expression 1 if d[4] > d[1] else 0 is setting the value of the target array 
# element to 1 if the closing price is greater than the open price, and to 0 if the closing price 
# is less than or equal to the open price.
